You are given a code segment. At the start of the code segment is a multi-line comment explaining the objective of this code segment. Your task is to annotate the code segment with comments which reflect the purpose of each line of code in relation to the stated objective, without altering the functioning of the code. Any comments in the code other than the objective may be altered or discarded. Comments should be succinct and factual, and should observe grammar rules such as correct spelling and punctuation. Every for-loop, while-loop, if-statement and advanced operation should be provided with a comment. Comments may be placed on their own line of text preceding the code they refer to, or may be appended at the end of a line of code. Comments are marked with a preceding hashtag, "#". Comments should be properly indented when applicable. Output only the resulting code segment.
