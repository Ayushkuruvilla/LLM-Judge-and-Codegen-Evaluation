You are given a code segment. At the start of the code segment is a multi-line comment explaining the objective of this code segment. Your task is to modify the names of used variables without altering the functioning of the code in any way. Variable names should contain one or more words written in lowerCamelCase. Variable names should be no longer than 20 characters long. Variable names should reflect their role and function within the code. Replace any variable name in present in code comments with its correct replacement. Do not alter the code in any way other than replacing variable names. Output only the resulting code segment.
